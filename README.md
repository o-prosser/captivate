# Captivate

I've always wanted a single destination where I can view notes, complete questions and find information on my subjects â€” so I'm building Captivate, a learning manager for students.

The project is open source and built using these technologies:
- Next.js (app router)
- Markdown (all notes have been written in markdown)
- PlanetScale (for the database)
- Uploadthing (image uploads)

... and lots more as the project progresses.

## Content disclaimer

In **no way** is the actual subject content on the site my own. I have collated resources from some amazing websites (physicsandmathstutor.com for topic papers, wjec.co.uk for subject information and past papers, and the notes produced by the WJEC and Bangor Univeristy which are the basis of the notes you will find on the site). All these websites are great sources!

## Project use

You are welcome to try out the app, but it's still in active development and many features may break or simply haven't been implemented yet.
