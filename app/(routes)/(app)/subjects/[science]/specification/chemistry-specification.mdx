## AS Unit 1 &mdash; The Language of Chemistry, Structure of Matter and Simple Reactions

Written examination: 1 hour 30 minutes

20% of qualification

### 1.1 Formulae and equations

The ability to represent reactions using chemical formulae and equations is an essential part of communicating knowledge and understanding in chemistry. This skill is of course required throughout the specification.

1. formulae of common compounds and common ions and how to write formulae for ionic compounds
2. oxidation numbers of atoms in a compound or ion
3. how to construct balanced chemical equations, including ionic equations, with appropriate use of state symbols

### 1.2 Basic ideas about atoms

The study of the structure of the atom is essential to understanding chemical reactions and radioactivity. There is an opportunity here to consider how the model of the atom has developed over time and how different models can be useful in explaining different observations.

1. nature of radioactive decay and the resulting changes in atomic number and mass number (including positron emission and electron capture)
2. behaviour of $\alpha$-, $\beta$- and $\gamma$-radiation in electric and magnetic fields and their relative penetrating power
3. half-life of radioactive decay
4. adverse consequences for living cells of exposure to radiation and use of radioisotopes in many contexts, including health, medicine, radio-dating, industry and analysis
5. significance of standard molar ionisation energies of gaseous atoms and their variation from one element to another
6. link between successive ionisation energy values and electronic structure
7. shapes of _s_- and p-orbitals and order of _s_-, _p_- and _d_-orbital occupation for elements 1-36
8. origin of emission and absorption spectra in terms of electron transitions between atomicenergylevels
9. atomic emission spectrum of the hydrogen atom
10. relationship between energy and frequency ($E = hf$) and that between frequency and wavelength ($f = 
\frac{c}{\gamma}$)
11. order of increasing energy of infrared, visible and ultraviolet light
12. significance of the frequency of the convergence limit of the Lyman series and its relationship with the ionisation energy of the hydrogen atom

### 1.3 Chemical calculations

An understanding of the amount of substance is fundamental to all chemical reactions. The majority of calculations appearing here are relevant throughout the course.

1. relative mass terms (atomic, isotopic, formula, molecular)
2. principles of the mass spectrometer and its use in determining relative atomic mass and relative abundance of isotopes
3. simple mass spectra, for example, that of chlorine gas
4. how empirical and molecular formulae can be determined from given data
5. relationship between the Avogadro constant, the mole and molar mass
6. relationship between grams and moles
7. concept of concentration and its expression in terms of grams or moles per unit volume (including solubility)
8. molar volume and correction due to changes in temperature and pressure
9. ideal gas equation ($pV = nRT$)
10. concept of stoichiometry and its use in calculating reacting quantities, including in acid-base titrations
11. concepts of atom economy and percentage yield
12. how to estimate the percentage error in a measurement and use this to express numeric answers to the appropriate number of significant figures

### 1.4 Bonding

An understanding of bonding is fundamental in explaining why chemical reactions happen. This topic considers the electronic changes that take place in the formation of stable structures. These ideas will be referred to throughout the specification.

1. ionic bonding in terms of ion formation and the interaction between positive and negative ions in an ionic crystal
2. covalent bonding, including coordinate bonding, in terms of the sharing of electrons and the balance of forces of attraction and repulsion within the molecule
3. intermediate character of many bonds between purely ionic and purely covalent
4. concepts of electronegativity and bond polarity
5. forces between molecules being much weaker than covalent (and ionic) bonds
6. permanent and temporary dipoles and their relative effects on physical properties, such as boiling temperature and solubility
7. hydrogen bonding and its effect on physical properties, such as boiling temperature and solubility
8. VSEPR principle and its use in predicting the shapes of simple molecules and ions
9. bond angles associated with linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral and octahedral molecules and ions

### 1.5 Solid structures

This section relates the structures and properties of different types of solids to the bonding present within them. A thorough understanding of the differences between atoms, ions and molecules and of the difference between interactions within and between molecules is essential. A broader understanding could be developed by looking at the structures and properties of novel materials such as smart materials and &apos;bucky ball&apos; structures.

1. crystal structures of sodium chloride and caesium chloride
2. structures of diamond and graphite
3. structures of iodine and ice
4. &apos;electron sea&apos; model for bonding in metals
5. relationship between physical properties (for example, melting temperature, solubility, hardness and electrical conductance) and structure and bonding in ionic compounds, giant molecular substances, simple molecular substances and metals

### 1.6 The Periodic Table

The location of the elements in the Periodic Table can be explained by their atomic structure, which in turn can be utilised to explain trends and patterns down groups and across periods. Consideration should be given to the fact that the modern form of the Periodic Table developed over time with separate advances made by several scientists. There are ample opportunities here to carry out a range of practical work, including qualitative and quantitative problem-solving tasks. Recall of reactions studied at GCSE is assumed prior knowledge, e.g. Group 1 metals with water and Group 2 metals with dilute acids.

1. elements being arranged according to atomic number in the Periodic Table
2. electronic structures of the elements relate to their position in the _s_-, _p_- and _d_- blocks of the Periodic Table
3. oxidation and reduction in terms of electron transfer in reactions of _s_-, _p_- and _d_- block elements/compounds/ions
4. general trends in ionisation energy, melting temperature and electronegativity across periods and down groups
5. reactions of Group 2 elements with oxygen and water/steam
6. reactions of the aqueous cations $\ce{Mg^2+}$, $\ce{Ca^2+}$ and $\ce{Ba^2+}$ with $\ce{OH^-}$, $\ce{CO3^2-}$ and $\ce{SO4^2-}$ ions
7. characteristic flame colours shown by compounds of $\ce{Li}$, $\ce{Na}$, $\ce{K}$, $\ce{Ca}$, $\ce{Sr}$ and $\ce{Ba}$ ($\ce{Mg}$ compounds show no colour)
8. trend in general reactivity of Group 1 and Group 2 metals
9. trend in thermal stability of the Group 2 carbonates and hydroxides
10. trends in solubility of Group 2 hydroxides and sulfates
11. basic character of the oxides and hydroxides of Group 1 and Group 2 metals
12. trend in volatility of Group 7 elements (halogens)
13. reactions of the halogens with metals
14. trend in reactivity of the halogens in terms of relative oxidising power
15. reaction between aqueous $\ce{Ag^+}$ and halide ions followed by dilute aqueous $\ce{NH3}$
16. displacement reactions of halogens in terms of redox
17. use of chlorine and fluoride ions in water treatment and the related health and ethical issues
18. soluble salt formation and crystallisation, insoluble salt formation by precipitation and simple gravimetric analysis
