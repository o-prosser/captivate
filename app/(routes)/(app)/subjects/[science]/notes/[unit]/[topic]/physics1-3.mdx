### Newton's three laws of motion

<Callout emoji="1️⃣">

The first law states that if the resultant force on an object is zero then the object will either remain stationary, or if it was already moving, then it will continue to move with uniform motion.

</Callout>

<Callout emoji="2️⃣">

Newton's 2nd law states that the rate of change of momentum (= mass $\times$ velocity) is directly proportional to the applied (resultant) force and occurs in the same direction as the force:

$$
F = \frac{\text{change in } mv}{\text{change in } t} = \frac{d\left(mv \right)}{d\left(t\right)}
$$

</Callout>

<Callout emoji="3️⃣">

The 3rd law states that if body A exerts a force on body B, then body B exerts an equal but opposite force on body A. (To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction).

</Callout>

#### Newton's 2nd law

This can be simplified in the case where the mass is constant.

$$
F = m \times \frac{d\left(v\right)}{d\left(t\right)} = m \times \frac{v-u}{t} \text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ but } \frac{v-u}{t} = \text{acceleration}
$$

&#8756; $\Sigma F = ma$

<Columns left="where, ">
$\Sigma F$ is resultant force, N

$m$ is mass, kg

$a$ is acceleration, ms<sup>-1</sup>

</Columns>

**Note:** $F$ in this equation is always the resultant force.

#### Weight

Since weight is a type of force, we can apply the equation to calculate it:

$F = ma$, and hence $W = mg$, where $W$ = weight, $m$ = mass, and $g$ = acceleration due to gravity.

It is important to remember the distinction between mass and weight.

- Mass is a measure of how much matter or material an object has &mdash; measured in kg.
- Weight is a measure of how large the force of gravity on an object is &mdash; measured in N.

#### Newton's 3rd law

**Examples include**

- When a rocket fires its engine, the exhaust gasses are pushed downwards. This means the exhaust gasses push the rocket upwards with an equal force.

- The Sun&apos;s gravitational force pulls the Earth, the Earth pulls the Sun with an equal and opposite gravitational force.

- The propeller of a boat pushes against the water, the water pushes the boat with an equal and opposite force.

<Callout emoji="💡">

Although the two forces are equal and always opposite, they never 'cancel out' because they always act on **different objects**.

</Callout>

The momentum, $p$, of an object is a vector and is equal to its mass, $m$, multiplied by its velocity, $v$. It is measured in units of kg ms<sup>-1</sup>.

$$
p=mv
$$

### Conservation of momentum

<Callout emoji="✏️">

The total momentum of a system of interacting bodies will remain constant if there are no external forces acting.

</Callout>

#### Example

_A bumper car is a fairground of mass_ 95 kg _is travelling at a speed of_ 2.8 ms<sup>-1</sup> _when it collides with another car (initially not moving) of mass_ 140 kg. _If the speed of the 1st car after collision is_ 0.4 ms<sup>-1</sup> _in the opposite direction, calculate the velocity of the 2nd car._

$$
\begin{align}
m_1u_1 + m_2u_2 &= m_1v_1+m_2v_2 \\
\left(95 \times 2.8 \right) + 0 &= \left(95 \times -0.4 \right) + \left(140 \times v_2 \right) \\
266 &= -38 + 140v_2 \\
266+38 &= 140v_2 \\
v_2 &= 2.17 \text{ ms}^{-1}
\end{align}
$$

Notice the negative sign before the 0.4 &mdash; the forwards direction of the 1st car is taken as positive, hence the backwards motion is negative.

### Elastic and inelastic collisions

If you calculate the kinetic energy ($E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$) in the exmaple above, you will see that $E_k$ before is 372.4 J, but that after the collision, the total $E_k$ of both cars is 377.7 J. This is an example of an **inelastic collision**, where some of the kinetic energy of the system is lost to the surroundings.

In an **elastic collision**, no kinetic energy is lost.

Elastic collisions can only realistically occur when individual particles are interacting, e.g. an alpha particle approaching another alpha particle &mdash; most everyday collisions incur a significant energy lost, but we can still apply the conservation of momentum.

#### Newton's 2nd law and momentum

Also, remember that Newton's 2nd law refers to momentum: $F$ = rate of change of momentum.

This means that if we plot a graph of momentum against time, then: **force is equal to the gradient of the momentum-time graph**.
