# Flashcards

Flashcards are a key part of your revision &mdash; helping you to develop a deep understanding and remember everything you need before your exam.

Captivate comes with flashcards for each subject, adapted from [Physics and Maths Tutor](https://physicsandmathstutor.com). Flashcards are sorted into groups, such that there is a group for each topic of a subject. This helps you start revising the correct topic easily.

## Studying flashcards

There are two ways to study your flashcards:

1. All
2. Spaced repitition

Studying all flashcards for a group will allow you to practise all your flashcards, without worrying about spaced repition. This is great for when you want to quickly practise before an exam or test, when you want to see all of your flashcards.

Spaced repitition is the best way to practise your flashcards &mdash; it&apos;s scientifically proven. Spaced repition builds on the forgetting curve, which simply says that you need to practise flashcards at certain intervals, for the best impact. By choosing spaced repitition, you can mark how well you were able to answer a flashcard and allow Captivate to calculate when you should next see the card for best impact. This means that you may have more flashcards on some days, and see some less regularly as you answer them better.
