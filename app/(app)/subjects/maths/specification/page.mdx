### 1.1 Proof

1. Understand and use the structure of mathematical proof, proceeding from given assumptions through a series of logical steps to a conclusion; use methods of proof, including:
   1. proof by deduction,
   2. proof by exhaustion,

6. Solve linear and quadratic inequalities in a single variable and interpret such inequalities graphically, including inequalities with brackets and fractions.

7. Express solutions through the correct use of &lsquo;and&rsquo; and &lsquo;or&rsquo;, or through set notation.

8. Represent linear and quadratic inequalities graphically.

9. Manipulate polynomials algebraically, including expanding brackets and collecting like terms, factorisation and simple algebraic division; use of the Factor Theorem.

10. Understand and use graphs of functions; sketch curves defined by simple equations, including polynomials.

11. $y = \frac{a}{x}$ and $y = \frac{a}{x^2}$, including their vertical and horizontal asymptotes.

15. Understand the effect of simple transformations on the graph of $y = f (x)$ including sketching associated graphs: $y=af(x)$, $y=f(x)+a$, $y=f(x+a)$, $y=f(ax)$.

### 1.3 Coordinate geometry in the $(x,y)$ plane

1. Understand and use the equation of a straight line, including the forms $y=mx+c$, $y-y_1 =m(x-x_1)$ and $ax+by+c=0$; gradient conditions for two straight lines to be parallel or perpendicular.

2. Be able to use straight line models in a variety of contexts.

3. Understand and use the coordinate geometry of the circle using the equation of a circle in the form $(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2$; completing the square to find the centre and radius of a circle.

4. Use of the following circle properties:
   1. the angle in a semicircle is a right angle;
   2. the perpendicular from the centre to a chord bisects the chord;
   3. the radius of a circle at a given point on its circumference is perpendicular to the tangent to the circle at that point.

1. Know and use the function $a^x$ and its graph, where a is positive.

2. Know and use the function $e^x$ and its graph.

3. Know that the gradient of $e^{kx}$ is equal to $ke^{kx}$ and hence understand why the exponential model is suitable in many applications.

5. Know and use the function $lnx$ and its graph.

6. Know and use lnx as the inverse function of $e^x$.

7. Understand and use the laws of logarithms.

   $\log _{a} x + \log _{a} y = \log _{a} (xy)$

   $\log _{a} x - \log _{a} y = \log _{a} \left(\frac{x}{y}\right)$

   $k \log _{a} x = \log _{a} \left(x^k\right)$ (including, for example $k = â€“1$, $k = - \frac{1}{2}$)

8. Solve equations in the form $a^x = b$.

9. Use logarithmic graphs to estimate parameters in relationships of the form $y=ax^n$ and $y=kb^x$, given data for $x$ and $y$.

10. Understand and use exponential growth and decay; use in modelling (examples may include the use of e in continuous compound interest, radioactive decay, drug concentration decay, exponential growth as model for population growth.)

11. Consideration of limitations and refinements of exponential models.

### 1.7 Differentiation

1. Understand and use the derivative of $f(x)$ as the gradient of the tangent to the graph of $y = f (x)$ at a general point $(x, y)$; the gradient of the tangent as a limit; interpretation as a rate of change; sketching the gradient function for a given curve; second order derivatives.

2. Differentiation from first principles for small positive integer powers of $x$.

3. Understand and use the second derivative as the rate of change of gradient.

4. Differentiate $x^n$ for rational $n$, and related constant multiples, sums and differences.

6. Identify where functions are increasing or decreasing.
